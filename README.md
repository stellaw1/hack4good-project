# Hack4Good Project

### Summary

This project aims to support the separation of work and life in a work from home environment. To our surprise, although not needing to commute to work saves a lot of time and effort, it can also have negative effects.

With our offices being in the same space as our bedrooms, there is no way to separate work life from home life. Getting off work means switching off tabs or switching computers, instead of relocating from an office space to home now. Studies have shown that the lack of this waiting period makes it hard to switch away from work after hours.

This [article](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/news/the-rise-of-the-fake-commute-4974652/) shows that people have different habits they have replaced with their commutes to consciously prepare their minds for work.

Our project aims to tackle this issue by replicating the commute of driving to work/ being stuck in rush hour in VR.
